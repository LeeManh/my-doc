# Enum Type

Summary: in this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn about the TypeScript enum type and how to use it effectively.

## What is an enum

An enum is a group of named constant values.

To define an enum, you follow these steps:

- First, use the enum keyword followed by the name of the enum.

- Then, define constant values for the enum.

The following shows the syntax for defining an enum:

```ts
enum name {constant1, constant2, ...};
```

In this syntax, the constant1, constant2, etc., are also known as the members of the enum.

## TypeScript enum type example

The following example creates an enum that represents the months of the year:

```ts
enum Month {
  Jan,
  Feb,
  Mar,
  Apr,
  May,
  Jun,
  Jul,
  Aug,
  Sep,
  Oct,
  Nov,
  Dec,
}
```
